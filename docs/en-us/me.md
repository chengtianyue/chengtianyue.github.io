I am Charlie, a student from Beijing No.4 High School. My hobbies are playing basketball, coding, playing games, making videos, etc. Since I am interested in AI and AI technology, I created this site for sharing my own view of this field.

The picture above is me.

The first time I began to make websites was several years ago(still at junior high school). The teacher explained very briefly how the website works and how to make a website at that time and my website was perfect in my opinion. After I graduated from junior high school, I started learning some HTML and JavaScript and finally publish my site on GitHub.

Artificial intelligence has always been a subject that I am very interested in. Since AI has been developing rapidly in recent years: from the original AlphaGo to various products now, Artificial intelligence has even surpassed what humans can achieve in certain areas. How to applicate new technology to our life is a major problem artificial intelligence is facing today. The intention of this website is to discuss how deep learning and machine learning can be applied to our daily life.

Since I am still a student, the update might be a bit slow. I will try my best to update my latest ideas.
