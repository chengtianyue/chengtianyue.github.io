My hobbies are playing basketball, coding, playing games, making videos, etc. Since I am interested in AI and AI technology, I created this site for sharing my own view of this field.</p>\n<img src=\"img/me.jpg\" alt=\"me\" style=\"zoom:50%;\" />\n<p>The picture above is me.</p>\n<p>The first time I began to make websites was several years ago(still at junior high school). The teacher explained very briefly how the website works and how to make a website at that time and my website was perfect in my opinion. After I graduated from junior high school, I started learning some HTML and JavaScript and finally publish my site on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has always been a subject that I am very interested in. Since AI has been developing rapidly in recent years: from the original AlphaGo to various products now, Artificial intelligence has even surpassed what humans can achieve in certain areas. How to applicate new technology to our life is a major problem artificial intelligence is facing today. The intention of this website is to discuss how deep learning and machine learning can be applied to our daily life.</p>\n<p>Since I am still a student, the update might be a bit slow. I will try my best to update my latest ideas.</p>\n<p>Moreover, please subscribe to my Social Media channel to see my latest updates!</p>\n<p>YouTube：<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x-F9jxkskJYnnrn3GkbDA?view_as=subscriber\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x-F9jxkskJYnnrn3GkbDA?view_as=subscriber</a></p>\n<p>Bilibili：<a href=\"https://space.bilibili.com/27081170\">https://space.bilibili.com/27081170</a></p>\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/chengtianyue\">https://github.com/chengtianyue</a></p>\n",
